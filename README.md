### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt that we tended to learn topics -- such as fetch api -- after having to implement them in the day's milestones for our project. I was able to learn independently, but it would have been more efficient to learn ahead of time.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have used the youtube api to get trailers for each movie instead of hard coding only the Inside Out 2 trailer. I would have also tried to add an animation that essentially smoothly transitions the Movie Card hover popup to the modal upon clicking. I also would have liked to implement the sidebar in order to display the movies delineated by the user as favorited or watched.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I appreciated that my peers liked my general aesthetics, such as the hover effect for each movie card, the Devflix logo, and some other subtle styling features. Something that I noticed from a peer and implemented was the live search by keystroke input, rather than waiting for a submit button to be pressed.

### Shout out

I'd like to really thank Cristobal, because he was incredibly helpful in fostering my understanding of fetching data from the TMDb api. I also want to thank Emmanuel, Lauryn, and David for daily miscellaneous support. Lastly, I'd like to thank my advisor Thomas for a very insightful check in -- it was great to take a break and have a genuine conversation with someone who very visibly cares.
